            <p>
              The average cost of a long-distance residential move can vary
              widely depending on several factors, including the distance of the
              move, the size of the home, the volume or weight of belongings,
              additional services required, and the specific moving company's
              rates. However, to provide a rough estimate, long-distance
              residential moves typically range from $1300 to $3,000 for a
              one-bedroom apartment and up to $10,000 or more for larger homes.
              <br />
              Generally, moves to popular destinations may be cheaper due to
              higher demand and more frequent routes.
